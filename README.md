# NTDRW

NTDRW_INT.py is the intialisation file to run the system on an input or folder of input images. This file also downloads all the layout model wieght once started.

NTDRW_CLASS2.py contains the class function that does all the system analysis. Starting with layout, written analysis and then image analysis. Then if selected (by defualt) the file will analyse all the extracted images and text. Output lots of text files and image copies.

model.py just contains all the tensorflow models that I have coded.

NTDRW.yml is the enivroment file needed to run the system.
